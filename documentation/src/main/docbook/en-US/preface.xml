  <para>This guide describes how to download, install, configure, and run the
  Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) used to verify the compatibility of an
  implementation of &jsrVersion;;: Bean Validation 1.1.</para>

  <para>The Bean Validation TCK is built atop <ulink
  url="http://www.jboss.org/arquillian.html">Arquillian</ulink>, a portable
  and configurable automated test suite for authoring unit and integration
  tests in a Java EE environment.</para>

  <para>The Bean Validation TCK is provided under the <ulink

    <title>Who Should Use This Guide</title>

    <para>This guide is for implementors of the Bean Validation specification
    to assist in running the test suite that verifies the compatibility of
    their implementation.</para>

    <title>Before You Read This Guide</title>

    <para>The Bean Validation TCK is based on the Bean Validation
    specification 1.1 (&jsrVersion;). Information about the specification,
    including links to the specification documents, can be found on the <ulink
    url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303">JSR-349 JCP page</ulink>.</para>

    <para>If you are running the Bean Validation TCK for the first time, read
    <xref linkend="introduction"/> completely for the necessary background
    information about the TCK. Once you have reviewed that material, perform
    the steps outlined in the remaining chapters.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="introduction"/> gives an overview of the
        principles that apply generally to all Technology Compatibility Kits
        (TCKs), outlines the appeals process and describes the Bean Validation
        TCK architecture and components. It also includes a broad overview of
        how the TCK is executed and lists the platforms on which the TCK has
        been tested and verified.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="appeals-process"/> explains the process to be
        followed by an implementor should they wish to challenge any test in
        the TCK.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="installation"/> explains where to obtain the
        required software for the Bean Validation TCK and how to install it.
        It covers both the primary TCK components as well as tools useful for
        troubleshooting tests.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="configuration"/> details the configuration of the
        JBoss Test Harness, how to create a TCK runner for the TCK test suite
        and the mechanics of how an in-container test is conducted.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="reporting"/> explains the test reports that are
        generated by the TCK test suite and introduces the TCK audit report as
        a tool for measuring the completeness of the TCK in testing the
        JSR-303 specification and in understanding how test cases relate to
        the specification.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="executing"/> documents how the TCK test suite is
        executed. It covers both modes supported by the TCK, standalone and
        in-container, and shows how to dump the generated test artifacts to
        disk</para>
